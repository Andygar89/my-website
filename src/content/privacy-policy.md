# Our promise to transparency

Naked Labs is built and operated as a privacy-first company. We wholly embrace the principles and philosophies that web3 & blockchain technology bring to the table. Consequently, as open source enthusiasts, all of our code is going to be open sourced, in an effort to create an as transparent environment as can be.

# Retention of Data

Naked Labs does not retain any personal data, but rather only collects certain off-chain meta-data to not query the blockchain needlessly. It is used for internal analytical purposes and to render visual UI components in this NFT marketplace.
